Nuclear reactors with liquid fuel offer multiple advantages over their 
solid-fueled siblings: improved inherent safety, fuel utilization, thermal 
efficiency, online reprocessing, and potential for nuclear fuel cycle closure. 
Interest in advanced liquid-fueled nuclear systems, particularly \glspl{MSR}, 
has grown recently with numerous new commercial \gls{MSR} concepts. 
However, most contemporary reactor physics software is incapable of performing 
fuel depletion calculations for such advanced reactors. To further 
develop liquid-fueled reactor designs, researchers need a simulation tool for 
performing fuel depletion calculations while taking into account online fuel 
reprocessing and refueling. Current modeling efforts in the literature usually 
assume ideal (e.g., 100\% of neutron poison being removed) rather than 
realistically-constrained removal efficiency. 

This work aims to provide a flexible tool, SaltProc, for simulating the fuel 
depletion in a generic nuclear reactor with liquid, circulating fuel. 
SaltProc allows the user to specify realistically constrained extraction 
efficiency of fission products based on physical models of fuel processing 
components appearing in various \gls{MSR} systems. Moreover, SaltProc can 
maintain reactor criticality by adjusting the geometry of the core. This 
work demonstrates and validates SaltProc for lifetime-long and short-term 
depletion calculation in two \gls{MSR} designs: the \gls{MSBR} and the 
\gls{TAP} \gls{MSR}. SaltProc successfully captured the evolution of fuel salt 
composition and major safety parameters (temperature and void coefficient of 
reactivity, shutdown margin) during reactor operation with various noble gas 
extraction efficiencies. Finally, a simple uncertainty propagation via Monte 
Carlo depletion calculations in this work shows that the nuclear data-related 
error (0.5-8\% depending on the isotope) is two orders of magnitude greater 
than the stochastic error 
($<0.07$\%).
