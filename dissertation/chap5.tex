\chapter{Tool demonstration for load-following and safety analysis: 
Transatomic Power MSR}
\paragraph*{Short-term (transient).} I performed the 24-hour-long depletion 
simulation with changing, load following reactor power with the fine time 
resolution (variable depletion step from 1 to 30-min). The depletion 
calculation for the \gls{TAP} in load following regime capture the effects of 
xenon poisoning and evaluate the benefit of using an online gas removal system.

In this chapter, I also analyze the reactor load-following capability for 
various moderator configurations and fuel salt compositions to bound design 
parameters of gas removal system to ensure load-following operation.
