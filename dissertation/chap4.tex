\chapter{Tool demonstration: Transatomic Power MSR}

In this chapter, I demonstrate SaltProc v1.0 capabilities for the \gls{TAP} 
\gls{MSR}. The \gls{TAP} concept was selected because it is well analyzed in 
the literature \cite{betzler_two-dimensional_2017, betzler_assessment_2017-1};
thus, code-to-code verification with ChemTRITON/SCALE is possible 
\cite{betzler_assessment_2017-1}. The demonstration was performed for two 
timescales:
\paragraph{Long-term.} I performed the \gls{TAP} \gls{MSR} core lifetime-long 
(25 years) depletion simulation with moderate time resolution (3-day depletion 
step) and constant, 100\% power level. The 
results obtained with SaltProc v1.0 are compared with recent efforts discussed 
in Chapter 1, more specifically with full-core \gls{TAP} depletion analysis 
with ideal removal efficiencies by Betzler \emph{et al.}  
\cite{betzler_assessment_2017-1}. This validation effort showed that SaltProc 
v1.0 solution is correct for the case with \emph{ideal extraction efficiency}.
\paragraph{Short-term (transient).} I performed the 24-hour-long depletion 
simulation with changing, load following reactor power with the fine time 
resolution (variable depletion step from 1 to 30-min). The depletion 
calculation for the \gls{TAP} in load following regime capture the effects of 
xenon poisoning and evaluate the benefit of using an online gas removal system.

In this chapter, I also analyze the reactor load-following capability for 
various moderator configurations and fuel salt compositions to bound design 
parameters of gas removal system to ensure load-following operation. 

\section{Transatomic Power Molten Salt Reactor concept design description}

The \gls{TAP} concept is a 1250 MW$_{th}$ \gls{MSR} with a LiF-based uranium 
fuel salt \cite{transatomic_power_corporation_technical_2016}. This concept 
uses configurable zirconium hydride rods as the moderator while most \gls{MSR} 
designs typically propose high-density reactor graphite. Zirconium hydride 
offers a much higher neutron moderating density than graphite: much less 
zirconium hydride volume is needed to achieve a thermal energy spectrum 
similar to one obtained with graphite moderator. Moreover, zirconium hydride 
has a much longer lifespan in extreme operational conditions (high 
temperature, large neutron flux, chemically aggressive salt) than reactor 
graphite. Finally, zirconium hydride is a nonporous material and holds up 
fewer neutron poisons (e.g., xenon, krypton) than does high-density 
reactor graphite.

In this section, the design characteristics and reprocessing plant design are 
based on information presented in the TAP white papers  
\cite{transatomic_power_corporation_technical_2016,
transatomic_power_corporation_neutronics_2016} and \gls{ORNL} technical 
reports \cite{betzler_two-dimensional_2017, betzler_assessment_2017-1}.

\subsection{General design description}

Figure~\ref{fig:tap-rendering} demonstrates a rendering of the primary and 
secondary loop of the \gls{TAP} \gls{MSR} seated inside a concrete nuclear 
island. Figure~\ref{fig:tap-primary-scheme} shows the schematic design of a 
520 MW$_{e}$, 2-loop nuclear reactor system with an intermediate salt loop.

	\label{fig:tap-primary-scheme}
\end{figure}

The \gls{TAP} design (figure~\ref{fig:tap-side-view}) is very similar to 
original \gls{MSRE} design developed by \gls{ORNL} 
\cite{haubenreich_experience_1970} but has two major innovations: 
the fuel salt composition and the moderator. The \gls{MSRE}'s 
LiF-BeF$_2$-ZrF$_4$-UF$_4$ salt has been substituted with LiF-UF$_4$ salt 
which allows for an increase in the uranium concentration within the fuel salt 
from 0.9 to 27.5\% while maintaining a relatively low melting point 
(490$^{\circ}$C compared with 434$^{\circ}$C for the original \gls{MSRE}'s 
salt) \cite{betzler_two-dimensional_2017}. The graphite has a very high 
thermal scattering cross section which makes it a perfect moderator but has 
a few major drawbacks: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item low lethargy gain per collision requires a large volume of 
	moderator to be present to reach criticality, which leads to a larger core 
	and obstructs the core power density;
	\item even special reactor-grade graphite has relatively high porosity, 
	consequently, it holds gaseous \glspl{FP} (e.g., tritium, xenon) in pores;
	\item reactor graphite lifespan in a commercial reactor is 
	approximately 10 years \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971}.
\end{enumerate}
As previously mentioned, to resolve these issues, the \gls{TAP} concept uses 
zirconium hydride instead of graphite, allowing for a more compact core and a 
significant increase in power density. These two innovative design choices, 
together with a configurable moderator (the moderator-to-fuel ratio can be 
changed during operation), facilitate the deployment of this conceptual design 
in the current commercially available 5\% enriched \gls{LEU} fuel cycle.

		rod bundles and shutdown rod (reproduced from Transatomic Power 
		White Paper \cite{transatomic_power_corporation_technical_2016}).}
	\label{fig:tap-side-view}
\end{figure}

The \gls{TAP} \gls{MSR} primary loop contains the reactor core volume  
(including the zirconium hydride moderator rods with silicon carbide  
cladding), pumps, and primary heat exchangers. Pumps circulate the  
LiF-(Act)F$_4$ fuel salt through the primary loop. The pumps, vessels, tanks, 
and piping are made of a nickel-based alloy (similar to Hastelloy-N\footnote{ 
Hastelloy-N is very common in \gls{MSR} concepts now, but was developed at 
\gls{ORNL} in the \gls{MSRE} program that started in the 1950s.}), which 
is highly resistant to corrosion in various molten salt environments. Inside 
the reactor vessel, near the zirconium hydride moderator rods, the fuel salt 
is in a critical configuration and generates heat. Table~\ref{tab:tap_tab} 
contains details of the \gls{TAP} system design which are taken from technical 
white paper \cite{transatomic_power_corporation_technical_2016} and a 
neutronics overview \cite{transatomic_power_corporation_neutronics_2016} as 
well as \gls{ORNL} analysis of the \gls{TAP} design 
\cite{betzler_two-dimensional_2017, betzler_assessment_2017-1}.

\subsection{Reactor core design}
In the \gls{TAP} core (Figure~\ref{fig:tap-core-ben}), fuel salt flows around 
moderator assemblies consisting of lattices of zirconium hydride rods clad in 
a corrosion-resistant silicone carbide. The \gls{TAP} reactor pressure vessel 
is a cylinder with an inner radius 150 cm, height 350 cm, and wall thickness 5 
cm made of a nickel-based alloy. 
\begin{figure}[t] % replace 't' with 'b' to 
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch4/tap_core_ornl.png}
	\vspace{-0.35in}
	\caption{The \gls{TAP} \gls{MSR} schematic core view showing moderator 
		rods (reproduced from ORNL/TM-2017/475  
		\cite{betzler_assessment_2017-1}).}
	\label{fig:tap-core-ben}
\end{figure}

The \gls{SVF} in the core is parameter similar to wide-used moderator-to-fuel 
ratio and can be defined as:
\begin{align}
SVF &= \frac{V_F}{V_F+V_M} = \frac{1}{1+V_M/V_F}
\intertext{where}
V_F &= \mbox{the fuel volume $[m^3]$} \nonumber \\
V_M &= \mbox{the moderator volume $[m^3]$} \nonumber \\
V_M/V_F &= \mbox{the moderator-to-fuel salt ratio $[-]$.} \nonumber
\end{align}

Figure~\ref{fig:svf-predetermined} shows the \gls{SVF} variation during  
operation that shifts the reactor neutron energy spectrum from intermediate to 
thermal to maximize fuel burnup. At the \gls{BOL}, a high \gls{SVF} is 
selected to obtain relatively hard spectrum and enhance fertile material 
($^{238}$U) conversion into the fissile material ($^{239}$Pu) while the 
startup fissile material ($^{235}$U) inventory is still large. As fissile 
concentration in the fuel salt declines, an additional moderator are 
introduced to maintain criticality, leading to salt volume fraction decrease 
(see Figure~\ref{fig:svf-predetermined}).

Initial \gls{TAP} concept suggested vary salt volume fraction by inserting 
fixed-sized moderator rods via the bottom of the reactor vessel (for safety 
considerations), similarly to moving the control rods in a \gls{BWR}, as shown 
in Figure~\ref{fig:tap-side-view} 
\cite{transatomic_power_corporation_neutronics_2016}. The later \gls{TAP} 
concept proposes reducing the \gls{SVF} by reconfiguring the moderator rods 
during regular shutdown for reactor maintenance 
\cite{betzler_assessment_2017-1}. For the 
\gls{TAP} reactor, \gls{EOL} occurs when the maximum number of moderator rods 
are inserted into the core, and a further injection of fresh fuel salt does 
not alter criticality. Unmoderated salt is flowing in the annulus between the 
core, and the vessel wall provides for a potential reduction in fast neutron 
flux at the vessel structural material .

	reactor (reproduced from Transatomic Power Neutronics Overview

\end{figure}


\subsection{Fuel salt reprocessing system}
The \gls{TAP} nuclear island contains a fission product removal system. 
Gaseous \glspl{FP} are continuously removed using an off-gas system while 
liquid and 
solid \glspl{FP} are extracted via a chemical processing system. As these 
byproducts are gradually removed, a small quantity of fresh fuel salt is 
regularly added to the primary loop. This process conserves a constant fuel 
salt mass and keeps the reactor critical. In contrast with the \gls{MSBR} 
reprocessing system, the \gls{TAP} design does not need a protactinium 
separation and isolation system because it operates in a uranium-based 
single-stage fuel cycle. The authors of the \gls{TAP} concept suggested three 
distinct fission product removal methods 
\cite{transatomic_power_corporation_neutronics_2016}:
\paragraph{Off-Gas System:} The off-gas system removes gaseous fission 
products such as krypton and xenon, which are then compressed and stored 
temporarily until they have decayed to the background radiation level. Trace 
amounts of tritium are also removed and bottled in a liquid form via the same 
process. Also, the off-gas system directly removes a small fraction of the 
noble metals.
\paragraph{Metal Plate-Out/Filtration:} A nickel mesh filter removes noble and 
semi-noble metal solid fission products as they plate out onto internal surface
of the filter.
\paragraph{Liquid Metal Extraction:} Lanthanides and other non-noble metals 
stay dissolved in the fuel salt. They generally have a lower capture cross 
section and thus absorb fewer neutrons than $^{135}$Xe, but their extraction 
is essential to ensure normal operation. In the \gls{TAP} reactor, lanthanide 
removal is accomplished via a liquid-metal/molten salt extraction process 
similar to that developed for \gls{MSBR} by \gls{ORNL}  
\cite{robertson_conceptual_1971}. The process converts the dissolved 
lanthanides into a well-understood oxide waste form, similar to that of 
\gls{LWR} \gls{SNF}. This oxide waste comes out of the \gls{TAP} reprocessing 
plant in ceramic granules and can be sintered into another convenient form for 
storage \cite{transatomic_power_corporation_technical_2016}.

Figure~\ref{fig:tap-reproc} shows the principal design of the \gls{TAP} 
primary loop, including an off-gas system, nickel mesh filter, and lanthanide 
chemical extraction facility. Similarly to the \gls{MSBR}, an off-gas system 
is also based on a simple process of helium sparging through fuel salt with 
consequent gas bubbles removed before returning the fuel salt to the core (see 
Section~\ref{sec:gas-separ}). 
Nevertheless, one crucial difference must be noted: the \gls{MSBR} gas 
separation system suggested helium injection and subsequent transport of the 
voids throughout the primary loop, including the core for at least ten full 
loops \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971}. 
\begin{figure}[htp!] % replace 't' with 'b' to 
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{ch4/tap_primary_loop.png}
	\caption{Simplified \gls{TAP} primary loop design including off-gas system 
		(blue), 
		nickel filter (orange) and liquid metal extraction system (green) 
		(reproduced from \cite{transatomic_power_transatomic_2019}).}
	\label{fig:tap-reproc}
\end{figure}

Introduction of the void (helium bubbles) during operation is a significant 
concern for safe, stable operation because the increase of void fraction in 
the fuel salt when it enters back to the core would cause unpredictable 
reactivity change. Kedl stated, ``Average loop void fractions as high as 1\% 
are undesirable... it is desirable to keep the average loop void fraction well 
below 1\%.''\cite{robertson_conceptual_1971} but he did not offer an 
explanation why. In fact, the \gls{MSBR} design targeted 0.2\% average void in 
the fuel salt \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971} and successfully operated the 
\gls{MSRE} with average void fraction below 0.7\% \cite{compere_fission_1975}.
We can reduce void fraction in the fuel salt to negligible levels by using an 
effective gas separator for stripping helium/xenon bubbles before returning 
the salt to a primary loop (Figure~\ref{fig:tap-reproc}, blue block). 

Noble and semi-noble metal solid fission products tend to plate out onto metal 
surfaces including piping, heat exchanger tubes, reactor vessel inner surface, 
etc. Previous research by \gls{ORNL} \cite{robertson_conceptual_1971} reported 
that about 50\% of noble and semi-noble metals would plate out inside 
\gls{MSBR} systems (including off-gas system) without any special treatment. 
To improve the extraction efficiency of these fission products, the \gls{TAP} 
concept suggested employing a nickel mesh filter located in a bypass stream in 
the primary loop (Figure~\ref{fig:tap-reproc}, orange block). The main idea of 
this filter is to create large nickel surface area using porous metal (e.g., 
Inconel fibers). The fuel salt is flowing throughout the filter and noble 
metals plate-out on the internal filter surface. 

This Liquid Metal Extraction process for the \gls{TAP} concept has been 
adopted from the \gls{MSBR}. The \gls{MSRE} demonstrated a liquid-liquid 
extraction process for removing rare earths and lanthanides from fuel salt and 
estimated efficiency of this process. 
In fact, due to similarities in reprocessing schemes, the \gls{TAP} project 
reported almost the same set of elements for removal and similar effective 
cycle times as suggested for \gls{MSBR} (Table~\ref{tab:reprocessing_list}). 
The \gls{TAP} neutronics whitepaper specifies additional low-probability 
fission products and gases that should be removed during operation. These 
elements are categorized into the previously defined processing groups, but 
the removal rates of most of these elements (all except for hydrogen) 
are very low.

Details of gas removal and fuel reprocessing systems have historically 
been conceptual. Accordingly, liquid-fueled system design including the 
\gls{TAP} concept usually assumes ideal (rather than realistically 
constrained) removal efficiencies for reactor performance simulations. In this 
thesis, I developed a realistic online reprocessing system and reactor model 
to capture the dynamics of fuel composition evolution during reactor 
operation. Gas removal efficiency is variable in that model, described using 
mathematical correlation from Chapter 2 (see Equation~\ref{eq:gas_eff}). For 
the other \glspl{FP}, a fixed\footnote{ 
	Published information about dynamics of extraction efficiency during 
	reactor 
	operation for seminoble metals, volatile fluorides, and rare earths is 
	insufficient to inform a variable removal efficiency.}, non-ideal 
extraction efficiency based on cycle time from  
Table~\ref{tab:reprocessing_list} was used to inform the fuel reprocessing 
model.

\section{TAP system model}
In this section, the \gls{TAP} core and fuel salt reprocessing system models  
for demonstrating SaltProc v1.0 are described in details. I used these models 
for SaltProc demonstration and validation for both long-term and short-term 
cases.

\subsection{Serpent 2 full-core model} \label{sec:tap_model}
Nest and lattice geometry types as well as universe transformation 
capabilities of Serpent \cite{leppanen_serpent_2014} are employed to 
represent \gls{TAP} core. Figure~\ref{fig:tap-serpent-plan} shows the $XY$ 
section of the whole-core model at the expected reactor operational level 
when all control rods are fully withdrawn. Figures~\ref{fig:tap-serpent-elev} 
and \ref{fig:tap-serpent-elev-zoom} show a longitudinal section of the 
reactor. This model contains the moderator rods with silicon carbide cladding, 
pressure vessel, and inlet and outlet plena (Table~\ref{tab:tap_model_param}). 
Fuel salt flows around rectangular moderator assemblies consisting of lattices 
of small-diameter zirconium hydride rods in a corrosion-resistant material. 
The salt volume fraction for Figure ~\ref{fig:tap-serpent-plan} is 0.917204, 
which means the modeled core is under-moderated and has intermediate neutron 
spectrum. Quarter-core configurations of the \gls{TAP} core with various salt 
volume fraction, used in the current work to maintain criticality for 
reasonable operational period ($>20$ years), are listed in 
Table~\ref{tab:tap_adjustable_core}, Figures~\ref{fig:tap-406-681}, and 
\ref{fig:tap-840-1668} in Appendix~\ref{appex:geometries}.
\begin{figure}[htp!] % replace 't' with 'b' to

		with fully withdrawn control rods at \gls{BOL} (347 moderator rods, 
		salt volume fraction is equal 0.917204). 
		The violet color represents zirconium hydride, and the yellow 
		represents fuel salt. 
		The blue color shows Hastelloy-N, a material used for the vessel wall, 
		and the pink color is the air.}

	\label{fig:tap-serpent-elev}
\end{figure}

To represent the reactivity control system, the model has: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*), noitemsep]
	\item control rod guide tubes made of nickel-based alloy;
	\item control rods represented as a Boron Carbide (B$_4$C) cylinders 
	with a thin Hastelloy-N coating;
	\item air inside guide tubes and control rods;
\end{enumerate}
The control rods must be able to suppress excess reactivity at the \gls{BOL} 
when the core configuration is the most reactive and the neutron spectrum is 
the hardest. The control rod design shown on 
Figures~\ref{fig:tap-serpent-plan} and \ref{fig:tap-serpent-elev-zoom} is 
comprised of a cluster of 25 rods that provide a total reactivity worth of 
$4226\pm9pcm$ at the \gls{BOL}.

which allows the user to easily change the control rod position during the 
simulation. The current works assumed that all control rods are fully 
withdrawn from the core (Figure~\ref{fig:tap-serpent-elev-zoom}), but user can 
use SaltProc v1.0 reactivity control capabilities to change control 
rod position during operation. In this dissertation, all figures of the core 
were generated using the built-in Serpent plotter.

The neutron population per cycle and the number of active/inactive cycles were 
chosento obtain a balance between minimizing uncertainty for a transport 
problem (28 pcm for$k_{eff}$) and simultaneously minimizing computational 
time.


\subsection{Model of the fuel reprocessing system}
I thoroughly analyzed the original \gls{TAP} reprocessing system design 
(Figure~\ref{fig:tap-reproc}) and neutron poisons removal rates  
(Table~\ref{tab:reprocessing_list}) to determine a suitable reprocessing 
scheme for SaltProc v1.0 demonstration (Figure~\ref{fig:demo-repro-scheme}). 
This demonstration case assumed fixed, non-ideal ($<100$\%) removal 
efficiencies based on physical model for noble gas extraction efficiency 
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:gas-separ}.

\end{figure}

The gas removal components (sparger/contactor and entrainment separator) are 
located in-line because estimated full loop time for the fuel salt is about 20 
seconds and approximately equal to the cycle time 
(Table~\ref{tab:reprocessing_list}). To remove all volatile gases every 20 
seconds, the gas removal system must operate with 100\% of the core throughout 
flow rate (in-line gas removal system). For the demonstration case herein 
efficiency of xenon, krypton, and hydrogen extraction are determined using 
Peebles \emph{et al.} model (Equation~\ref{eq:gas_eff}) discussed earlier. 
Gas-liquid interfacial area per unit volume ($a$) to inform 
equation~\ref{eq:gas_eff} is a function of salt/gas flow rates and diameter of 
the gas bubbles \cite{sada_gas-liquid_1987}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:interfacial-area}
& a = \frac{6}{d_b}\frac{Q_{He}}{Q_{He} + Q_{salt}}
\intertext{where}
Q_{salt}&= \mbox{volumetric salt flow rate $[m^3/s]$} \nonumber \\
Q_{He}&= \mbox{volumetric helium flow rate $[m^3/s]$} \nonumber \\
d_b &= \mbox{helium bubble diameter $[m]$.} \nonumber
\end{align}

Extraction efficiencies are different for different gases because they have 
different solubility (Henry's law constant) in the salt. 
Table~\ref{tab:gas_removal_efficiency} reports Henry's law constants and 
corresponding efficiencies of migration noble gas to the helium bubbles in the 
sparger. Total separation efficiency (Table~\ref{tab:gas_removal_efficiency}) 
refers efficiency of extraction target gaseous element after performing helium 
sparging in the sparger following by separation of noble-gas-reach bubbles 
from the salt in the axial-flow centrifugal bubble separator 
\cite{gabbard_development_1974}.

The nickel filter in the \gls{TAP} concept is designed to extract 
noble/semi-noble metals and volatile fluorides 
(Table~\ref{tab:reprocessing_list}). Similarly to volatile gases, 
noble metals must be removed every 20 seconds and, hence, the filter should 
operate in-line also.The nickel filter removes a wide range of elements with 
various efficiencies (Table~\ref{tab:reprocessing_list}).

Lanthanides and other non-noble metals generally have a lower capture  
cross section and absorb fewer neutrons than gases and noble metals. These 
elements can be removed via a liquid-metal/molten salt extraction process with 
relatively low removal rates (cycle time $> 50$ days). This is accomplished 
by directing a small fraction of the salt mass flow leaving the nickel mesh 
filter (10\%). That fraction then flows to the liquid-metal/molten salt 
component of the reprocessing system, where lanthanides are removed with a 
specific extraction efficiency to match the  required cycle time 
(Table~\ref{tab:reprocessing_list}). The rest 90\% of the salt mass flow is 
directed from the nickel filter to heat exchanger without performing any fuel 
salt treatment.

The removal rates vary among nuclides in this reactor concept, which dictate 
the necessary resolution of depletion calculations. To compromise, a 3-day 
time was selected for the long-term demonstration case based on a timestep 
refinement study by Betzler \emph{et al.} \cite{betzler_assessment_2017-1}.

\section{Long-term depletion demonstration and validation}
\subsection{Constant, ideal extraction efficiency case}
To validate SaltProc v1.0, I performed lifetime-long depletion calculation 
with ideal extraction efficiency. This case was selected to repeat fuel salt 
depletion as close as possible to ChemTriton simulation for full-core 
\gls{TAP} core by Betzler \emph{et al.} \cite{betzler_assessment_2017-1}.  
Betzler \emph{et al.} made following assumptions and approximations in their 
work \cite{betzler_assessment_2017-1}:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]	
	\item Effective cycle times as prescribed by Transatomic Power Technical 
	White Paper (Table~\ref{tab:reprocessing_list}) with \textbf{100\% removal 
	efficiency}.
	\item 5\% \gls{LEU} feed rate is equal to rate of fisson product removal.
	\item 3-day depletion step.
	\item Quarter-core model with vacuum boundary condition.
	\item Delayed neutron precursor drift was neglected.
\end{enumerate}
I adopted those assumption for code-to-code verification of SaltProc v1.0 
against ChemTriton. ENDF/B-VII.1 \cite{chadwick_endf/b-vii.1_2011} nuclear 
data library is used for this case to be consistent with Betzler's work.
But some crucial information has not been reported: core geometries for 
various moderator rod configurations except startup configuration, excess 
reactivity at startup, S($\alpha, \beta$) data and temperature used. In this 
section, I made best effort to repeat Betzler \emph{et al.} simulation using 
same input data to validate SaltProc for the \gls{TAP} reactor.


\subsubsection{Effective multiplication factor}
Figures~\ref{fig:keff-ben-valid} and \ref{fig:keff-ben-valid-zoomed} 
demonstrate the effective multiplication factor obtained using SaltProc v1.0 
with Serpent. The $k_{eff}$ was obtained after removing fissionproducts and 
adding feed material at the end of each depletion step (3 days for this case). 
SaltProc v1.0 predicts value of $k_{eff}$ at the end of next depletion step, 
and switches to geometry file with better moderator-to-fuel ratio if the 
predicted $k_{eff}$ might drops below 1. This algorithm mimics regular 
maintenance shutdown when the \gls{TAP} core excess reactivity is exhausted, 
and moderator rod assemblies should be reconfigured to operate next cycle. The 
$k_{eff}$ fluctuates significantly as a result of the batch-wise nature of 
the online reprocessing approach used.

Loading the initial fuel salt composition with 5\% \gls{LEU} into the 
\gls{TAP} core leads to a supercritical configuration with an excess 
reactivity of about 3200pcm (Figure~\ref{fig:keff-ben-valid}). Without
performing any fuel salt reprocessing and spectrum shifting, the core became 
subcritical after 30 days of operation \cite{rykhlevskii_milestone_2019}. 
SaltProc calculates an operational lifetime of 22.5 years which is lower than 
ChemTriton result for the full-core simulation (29.0 years).
